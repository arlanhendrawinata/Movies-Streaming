# LANFLIX movies streaming

This project is a **Netflix clone**

I made this to practice my programming skills

This streaming system is made by taking the **video_id** from **YouTube**, then entered into the data film.

So when movie data is called, **video_id on movie data is concatenated with youtube link**

This system also has **CRUD function**
